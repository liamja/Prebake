A set of Adblock filters to block obtrusive EU cookie law notices.

Details
-------

The _Obtrusive_ list blocks cookie notices that either consume a
considerable amount of screen real estate or popup and distract the
viewers attention.

The _Quiet_ list blocks all other notices regardless of their size
or obnoxiousness. Using this list isn't recommended but is provided
for completeness. Simple two- or three-word links to privacy pages
aren't blocked (such as links in a page footer), but a lengthy
paragraph mid-page will be.

Contribute
----------

There are going to be sites that I have missed, or I may have just
screwed up with a CSS selector. In any case, feel free to point out
bugs or request new sites to be added via the [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/liamja/Prebake/issues),
or [submit a pull request](https://github.com/liamja/Prebake/compare).

When adding a new filter, keep the list sorted and
update the `last modified` timestamp to match the current date.

User Agreement
--------------

By using these filters, you are accepting and allowing sites to
set cookies by default. You agree to allow the sites you visit to
set cookies.

Only use these filters if you understand the implications of
allowing cookies.
